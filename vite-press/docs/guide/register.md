# Register Command Guide

## About The Config
Bot have two behavior for the affiliated register command, the one is restrict behavior if you turn `auto_creation` on [Config](/install) to `true`, the restrict behavior will make command `/bind` and `Bind` button on `/interface` dissappear, this will make sure no one can create account on game but only in discord,<br/>
Second, is laxed behavior if you set the config to false, this bring back the `/bind` command and button. The register command is almost same as old bot but, in this bot there is few changes and improvement

## Command Explained
1. `/register` command or `Register` Button to make account in game and automatically binded its account, on launcher you will not find its empty anymore since its already fixed (no need the step to buy lincense on create character), the changes from the old bot is you does'nt need to use `/bind` anymore after this command, you just need to play your character ingame and you get full benefit for being `Registered`

2. `/bind` command or `Bind` button, to bind existing account in game into bot to get `Registered` benefit, this same as old bot but youdoesnt get the promp to select characters anymore.

3. `/switch` command or `Switch` button to change and select main character you had, this what make the bot now different from old bot, the old doesnt have a way to change character except by unbinding that will cause their currency being reseted.since selecting main character is essential, using this command is necessary after `/bind` or `/create` but doesnt worry, using any command will make you access this command instead for first time.<br/>

4. `/purge` is Admin only command equivalent of `/unbind` in old command
::: info
